A tcp/udp/ip protocol stack module.

The stack can be used in one of two main modes:

1) It can be interfaced to the 5 thread ethernet module using two XC channels.
   The main thread function is called uip_server in this case.

2) It can run as part of a two thread integrated TCP plus ethernet. In this
   case the main thread function will be uipSingleServer.

See the documentation for more details.
